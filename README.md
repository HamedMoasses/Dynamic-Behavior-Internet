Nowadays, most major operating systems and computer networks,
                               and even the Internet, which is the largest network in the world,
                                use a protocol called the TCP / IP protocol. The limited bandwidth
                                 as well as the routing buffer limitations
                                 when network service requests increase, make network resources unresponsive,
                                  and if we don't have the right solution for network traffic management,
                                   the network becomes generally unstable. . These conditions increase the
                                    length of the queue formed in the routers, and this leads to an excessive
                                     delay in the arrival of packets to the destination, and may even cause no
                                      packets to reach their desired destination. These are just some of the
                                      goal setting shareware that you can use.
                                      Mostly in the field of control theory, the most important issue is sustainability
                                       as well as stabilization of dynamic systems, and considering the inherent ability
                                        and power of control science in the field of stabilization, the entry of this
                                        science into the field of traffic control in telecommunication networks is not unexpected.
                                         Since we can model telecommunications networks as a dynamic system, using control science
                                         in this area can solve many problems.
                                         So far, various methods have been proposed to prevent and control the phenomenon of overcrowding,
                                         most of which are well-known methods. The idea of using control theory concepts to solve the problem
                                          of overcrowding control has been around since the 1990s, and their goal is to use tools to analyze
                                          and design congestion controllers for networks in control engineering as There is a closed loop system.
                                          In general, to solve the problem of Internet congestion control with a systemic approach and also to
                                          use control theory, we will be able to consider the closed loop structure of the data transfer process
                                           in computer networks in such a way that a controller from the dynamic queue management family or Active
                                            queue management (AQM) is designed to be implemented in network routers, and the rest of the network is
                                            defined from the router's point of view, a control target system or plant.
